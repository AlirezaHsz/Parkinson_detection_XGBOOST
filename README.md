# Parkinson_detection_XGBOOST
Detecting Parkinson by XGBOOST model

In this notebook, we will explore the application of the XGBoost algorithm for detecting Parkinson's disease in patients. Parkinson's disease is a neurodegenerative disorder that affects movement, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment and management.

XGBoost is a powerful machine-learning algorithm known for its efficiency and accuracy in handling complex classification tasks. By training a model on a dataset of features extracted from patient data, we can leverage XGBoost to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease based on the given input.

The primary objectives of this notebook are as follows:
- Understand the basics of the XGBoost algorithm
- Prepare and preprocess the dataset for training
- Train an XGBoost model using the prepared data
- Evaluate the performance of the model
- Use the trained model to predict the presence of Parkinson's disease in new patients

## Resource:
The dataset was created by Max Little of the University of Oxford, in collaboration with the National Centre for Voice and Speech, Denver, Colorado, who recorded the speech signals. The original study published the feature extraction methods for general voice disorders.
